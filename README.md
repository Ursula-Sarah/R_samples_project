# BASIC SYNTAX AND COMMANDS ON R   
      ✏️The use of logical and  numerical operators    
      ✏️The really useful packages commonly needed during an R-project

# VISUALISATION SAMPLES
> #### Builgind a boxplot to visualize data📊  
>#### Voting according class and the number of the poor population 📈  

- Boxplot of the length petal distributions per species  
#### Here we have three species of flowers: setosa, virginica and versicolor. We can see that the virginica got the greater box surfaces than the two other species so it has the longest petals'length among the others

- Voting accoring class and the numner of the poor population 
#### And here we got another barplot wich the poor one has less motivation on voting beside the rich one.

# DATABASES  
> You can see  inside the dabase folder two files containing CSV and Excel files.

# MACHINE LEARNING SAMPLE  
>Inside this model using the pre-build dataset "iris", we have a classification of three species of flowers accoring to sepal and petal lenghts and widths.  

- First we will loading the datasets
- Define the size of seed reproductibility
- Creating a testing and training model
- Building a regression model corresponding
- Vizualising the regression model's result  
![linear regression](https://github.com/Ursula-Sarah/Ursula-Sarah/assets/103580286/739b231a-ef01-411f-8a22-38fdcab37b9f)  
- Forming a decision tree according to the datasets
- Vizualising the decision tree

- Predicting future values of petal's length according to the petal's width of our present datasets
- Using matrix confusion to evaluate the classification
